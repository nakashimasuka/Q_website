Website for La Quincaillerie made in React/Node.Js by Sofian Delalay.

This website let you to see some images from a database and then allows you to like or dislike theese images. 
You can also see the score board with every images in the database.

If you want to understand the code, there is a fex comments in the styles.css file, but none in the .js files... Wait I can explain, it's because I didn't had the time to write some comments in there. I prefered to spend more time on this dirty code (yes it's dirty I know that I can do better, but not in one day) rather than write comments that I don't actually need (yes I know comments are not for me but anyway).
I worked on one branch only. So you can see all my commits on the master branch. Even if I started earlier, I would have only one branch, because I don't think it's necessary to add branch when I'm alone. I know that it is a bad habit but this is how I work.

The only thing you can do right now is take a look at the front client and navigate from the vote page to the leaderboard.

If I had more time, I think I would have a database compiling with docker and the font client would allow you to vote for your favorite Q images. I would also filled the leaderboard. I think I would have had a LogIn/Register page, so you can know for wich images you actually voted.
If you want to know the main reason I didn't actually finished all what I wanted to do (except the fact that I started the project yesterday), is because I spend so much time on the design in css... I think if I had started by the devlopment itself (server/database/access to data) I think I would have more fonctionalities.
